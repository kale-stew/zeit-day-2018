# Using JavaScript to Teach Machines How to Do Cool Shit

What's the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence? Can we use JavaScript to teach machines? How easy is it to teach these machines to do cool shit?

In this talk, I cover the fundamentals of AI, introduce some basic definitions, and demonstrate those concepts using JavaScript.

<!-- I've linked to the projects [below](#those-projects-i-was-talking-about). -->
